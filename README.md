### Bugmuggle - Opensource Bug Tracking Web Application
Bugmuggle is a simple, easy to use bug tracking web application built with Nuxt.js. It's designed to be a lightweight and flexible bug tracking system that can be easily customized to fit your needs. It uses the Github API to authenticate users and access channels like sections to track and manage issues.

Bugmuggle is built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and deployed on Cloudflare Pages using [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com). All the data is stored in Cloudflare D1.
